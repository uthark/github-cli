# Problem
Develop a command-line tool that allows a user to interact with a GitHub organization.


# Behavior
The command-line tool should be able to conduct the following behavior against a GitHub organization:

Top-N repos by number of stars.
Top-N repos by number of forks.
Top-N repos by number of Pull Requests (PRs).
Top-N repos by contribution percentage (PRs/forks).

# Considerations
You should use GitHubâ€™s REST API v3. 

# Deliverable
Implement in any language of your choice. Consider how we might run your solution. If you normally 
develop with automated tests, please include them; otherwise please include a short list of manual 
tests.

# Time investment
We understand and appreciate the fact that you have a job and are doing this in your personal time. 
Knowing that different people have different levels of commitment outside of work, we only ask that
 you give us an estimate of when you think you could have this completed. Our experience has been 
 that this normally takes 3-5 hours of uninterrupted effort.
